This is "hack" cargo release build for zed git version. You ll have all benefits of zed BUT auto-updates are not disabled...

zed with all this auto updates but no sanboxed is not so secure...
I m trying to ran zed using firejail but I failed, so now I copy all needed libs in "user mode" and see what happens.(?)

My plan is something like this:
~/.local/bin/zed/
                ├── run_app.sh      # Script to set environment and run the app, called from ~/.local/share/applications/zed.desktop
                ├── zed             # The app binary
                └── lib/            # Folder containing all necessary shared libraries
                    ├── libssl.so.3
                    ├── libcrypto.so.3
                    ├── libcurl.so.4
                    └── ...


How to build AND install:
1. ran script as user
It will build AND install zed in user $HOME.

How to ran:
1. In theory there is an ~/.local/share/applications/zed.desktop
It working ok, by clicking icon desktop entry which will call the run_app.sh
2. run_app.sh set LD_PATH to  ~/.local/bin/zed/lib and start zed...
3. If desktop entry dont work or not appears (no doinst.sh exist...needed logout login) or try call zed from terminal:
~/.local/bin/zed/run_app.sh
4. Be sure that  ~/.local/bin is on your $USER $PATH

NOTE:
1. Althought zed works fine in my testings , this is a testing work!
2. This is not a valid SlackBuild, no slackdesc exist, no doinst.sh etc... no binary provided!
